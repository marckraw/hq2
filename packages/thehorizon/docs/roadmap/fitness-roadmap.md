## Fitness Module Roadmap

### Near-term

- Mobile polish: sticky Add Meal FAB, horizontal week scroller, larger touch targets
- User macro targets: configurable daily goals, over/under indicators, weekly totals
- Grocery list: generate from week, export/print/share

### Mid-term

- Drag-and-drop planning within day/week; duplicate/copy day/week
- Recipe enhancements: image uploads, step timers, scale servings, favorites, ratings
- Library improvements: pagination/infinite scroll, bulk tag edit, optimistic updates

### Long-term

- Integrations: Apple Health/Google Fit sync, barcode scanner, import from recipe URLs
- Reminders: “Plan today?” nudges, prep reminders night before
- Data model/auth: user-scoped data, soft delete, audit logs, roles

### Quality & DX

- E2E tests for create/edit/delete/plan flows
- Seed CLI for demo data
- Accessibility pass (labels, focus, contrast)
