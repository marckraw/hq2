## INTERNAL > INTRODUCTION

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

When it comes to High School Exchange Year by EF, the experience is the brand. So how do we make the brand feel more like the experience?

We do it by echoing the authentic humanness, enthusiasm, and care of the people who bring the program to life, on the ground, face to face.

We do it by acknowledging the reality that, yes, there will be challenges and yes, most will be overcome.

Because the truth is, in spite of our meticulous planning and decades of experience, High School Exchange Year by EF isn’t a program at all.

In reality, each student’s experience is handcrafted and unscripted. And some of the smallest moments they’ll live through will be the ones that are most defining.

Reflecting all of that in our communications will help set expectations we can deliver exceptionally well.

## INTERNAL > POSITIONING

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

EF is the only exchange year program that’s truly built for the opportunities and challenges that an exchange year offers.

- **PROVOCATIVE VERSION:** Our program is designed for imperfection.

---

## INTERNAL > AUDIENCE

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

We have a multitude of audiences – students, parents, host families, counselors and advisors. They span geography, age, income levels, and priorities. But they share a few crucial qualities.

Our audiences understand the benefits of personal growth, the value of different cultures, and that the world can teach far more than any classroom ever could. And in a world that’s increasingly filled with BS, they respect being told the truth.

In short, these are our people.

But while they’re wise in many ways, our audiences don’t know what they don’t know. They don’t know the difference between a J–1 visa and an F–1 visa, or that a program that only offers one country as a destination doesn’t mean there are limited experiences, it means there are deeper ones. So while we can say “EF All The Way” the meaning of that isn’t apparent. At every opportunity, let’s remember to help them see it and, more importantly, feel it.

## INTERNAL > OUR BRAND

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

You would think people would be interested in what we have to say.

You would think that the mere idea of spending one of their precious few teenage years far away from family and friends would mean students (and their parents) would sit wide–eyed and attentive as they read or watch every bit of content we create.

And you’d be wrong.

Because as significant as an exchange year is, it’s but one of a thousand things people are thinking about each day. Which means when we do create content, we must do so in a way that overcomes their filters – content that manages to get noticed. It’s for our audience’s own good.

After all, an exchange year is worthy of attention.

### INTERNAL > OUR BRAND > Our Voice

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

If you couldn’t tell by now, our voice is human. Yeah yeah, all brands tend to say that these days. But we mean it. (For example, not many other brands would say “yeah yeah”?)

We write how people talk. Sometimes with incomplete sentences. Sometimes with “like” or “um” or “eh.” Often, we use humor to make a serious point. Just like people.

But while our words may come in a casual manner, what they have to say is substantive, meaningful, and often moving.

Our voice demonstrates the fact that a 52,000–person organization can sound approachable without sacrificing our aura of confidence and expertise.

---

### INTERNAL > OUR BRAND > Our Look

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

The graphic language of High School Exchange Year by EF is a visual representation of a high school itself.

That is to say, its foundation is built on structure – a grid whose flexibility offers order and hierarchy for the wide range of communications we produce – be it word–driven, picture–driven, or a combination of the two.

But what makes our look truly ours is, each communication features an element or two that was made by hand. You know, the people part. A handwritten font. Or an element that breaks the perfection of the grid.

These small elements serve as a reminder that this is a program, yes, but a program powered by humans.

---

### INTERNAL > OUR BRAND > Our Message

_(NOTE: Internal copy is, as you might guess by the name, for internal purposes. Its role is to help unify and give guidance to communications for the brand.)_

Our program’s distinctiveness comes not only from our tone and look, but from our message itself. And we separate ourselves from our competitors for a simple reason:

**We tell the truth.**

The truth is, an exchange year is a highly unpredictable, often challenging experience. In spite of our decades of experience, meticulous preparation, and dedication to seeing a student’s experience from beginning to end, a reasonable percentage of the exchange years we sponsor will take an unexpected twist or two.

This isn’t a bad thing. On the contrary, it speaks to the authenticity of the experience. And it perfectly sets up the importance of having EF as a partner – all the way.

Having the confidence to be up front about the realities of an exchange year enables us to establish “trust through transparency” in a way our competitors will likely never duplicate.

---

### INTERNAL > OUR BRAND > Manifesto

_(NOTE: The purpose of the manifesto is to create an emotional summary of the brand and its beliefs about the world. Manifestos are sometimes used as internal rallying cries; sometimes, they’re turned into videos or posters for external use… And sometimes, they’re just included in a copy doc, never to be seen again. Your call, really.)_

America is not what you think it is.  
It’s not defined by the bright lights of New York City. Its unique character is not found along the beaches of Miami, or carved in the steep cliffs of the Rockies.

In fact, the memories most deeply ingrained in people’s minds – the ones that truly define America – they’re not the ones that get printed on postcards at all.

Because the real America is less a place than it is a spirit. A feeling.

It is a belief that anything is possible. And it reveals itself in the smallest, most ordinary of moments.

Learning the words to a school fight song. Or discovering Crumbl Cookies aren’t just an Instagram thing – they really exist!

It may be difficult to find, this American spirit.  
But once you find it, and feel it… you’ll never be the same.

Discover the real America, with the people who know it best.  
**High School Exchange Year, by EF.**

## OUTBOUND > LANDING PAGES

_(NOTE: The landing page makes the assumption that people have come here from other communications that reflect HSEY’s more honest, confident, human tone. The landing page continues to use that voice.)_

**HEADLINE:** There are parts of an exchange year that no one will tell you.

Doing an exchange year in the U.S. is not easy. Yes, your understanding of American culture will go far deeper than any holiday trip would ever allow. And yes, your English will very likely improve. But honestly, it’s challenging. For students, for parents, for the host families… Why are we sharing this? It’s simple:

**You’ll get more out of it when you know what goes into it.**

**SECTIONS:**

- The Parent Part
- The Host Family Part
- The EF Part
- The Student Ambassador Part

**CTA BUTTON:** Hear more now (for information meeting)

### SUBPAGE: The Student Part

**HEADLINE:** “I cried when I arrived. Then I cried when I left.”

**COPY:** Saying yes to an exchange year in America means saying “see you later” to friends and family back home. It means being open to new experiences – some you expect, some you don’t. It means you’re ready to grow more confident, more independent. And it also means you’re about to get close to your host family. So close, in fact, it might be hard when it comes time to once again say, “see you later.”

### SUBPAGE: The Parent Part

**HEADLINE:** If you pay more, you should expect more. So… expect more.

**COPY:** High School Exchange Year with EF is not the cheapest option. Because what you pay for is a program that has been creating exchange years since 1979. A program that provides a support network 24/7. A program that has curated a large, well–vetted network of caring and enthusiastic host families. A program that’s involved in every step of your child’s journey. Not through a “partner agency” or affiliate based in America. Us.

### SUBPAGE: The Host Family Part

**HEADLINE:** Yes, it’s your exchange year. But it’s also your host family’s.

**COPY:** It’s called “exchange” for a reason. Because when you spend a year in America living with a host family, everyone benefits. EF’s host families come in all the shapes and sizes you’d expect from a diverse country like the USA. And they volunteer to share their homes with you because they’re likely as curious about your culture as you are about theirs. So just know that as you learn about America, you’re not the only one who’ll be learning.

### SUBPAGE: The EF Part

**HEADLINE:** Not everything will go as planned. Pretty much like the rest of life.

**COPY:** One of our student ambassadors says, “Every experience is unique. And that’s what makes it perfect.” Of course, when the unexpected occurs, it helps to have a partner like EF, who’s orchestrated over 500,000 exchanges. That’s not a typo. 500,000. In that time, we’ve learned everything from how to best support students to why a J–1 Exchange Visitor visa has higher safety and quality standards than other visas. Who knew? Well, we did.

### SUBPAGE: The Student Ambassador Part

**HEADLINE:** This Is The Part That Our Ambassadors Couldn’t Wait To Tell You

**COPY:** While each exchange year experience is different, what remains the same is the enthusiasm that our student ambassadors feel as they tell you all about their adventures.

**FLYER:**

- **COVER HEADLINE:** We can answer every question you have about exchange years. Including “What’s an exchange year?”
- **INSIDE SPREAD HEADLINE:** Ok, so what’s an exchange year?  
  Simply put, an exchange year is a year you spend living in America. You’ll live with a welcoming American family, attend an American high school, and do things that, well, Americans do.  
  But actually, it’s not so simple.  
  Because truth be told, an exchange year will be one of the most life–shaping experiences you’ve ever had. It will be equal parts challenging and rewarding. And yes, you’ll return knowing English better. But more importantly, you’ll return knowing yourself better. You’ll know you can comfortably step out of your comfort zone. That you can face life’s situations with a lot more confidence.  
  In other words, an exchange year is the best year you haven’t had yet.

## INBOUND > CATALOGUE

_(NOTE: As the deepest, most complete collection of information about the HSEY program, the catalogue not only amplifies the strengths of the program, it also emphasizes the rich experience of EF and our knowledge of the USA.)_

**COVER HEADLINE:** Spend the rest of your life telling stories that begin with, “When I lived in the U.S…”

### SPREAD ONE: Introduction

**HEADLINE:** You know you’re in America when the best restaurant in town is called “Restaurant.”

**COPY:** There’s perhaps no more unique culture than America. And perhaps no greater opportunity than spending a year living and studying there.

Doing an exchange year in the United States means you’ll live with an American family, study at an American high school, and spend your days doing, you know, American things. And you’ll come away with stories that will take a lifetime to re–tell.

Maybe some days, you’ll be riding one of those signature yellow school buses. Maybe you’ll be celebrating your first Thanksgiving dinner with your host family. Maybe you’ll just be hanging around a mall, surrounded by newfound friends, laughing at the very stupidest of things.

We say “maybe” because, truth be told, every student’s exchange year is different.

And that’s what makes it perfect.

### SPREAD TWO: Focused on the USA

**HEADLINE:** Offering one country as a destination doesn’t mean there are limited experiences. It means there are deeper ones.

**COPY:** Without exception, when you’re focused on a task, you’re better at it. At EF, our focus is creating rich cultural experiences for students who want to spend a year in the United States. We know every region, every state… heck, we even know how many US towns share the name “Arlington.” (Want to impress your friends? The answer is 28.)

Living and learning during an exchange year in the United States means you’ll have a rich, diverse, once–in–a–lifetime experience, all while becoming really good at saying, “Yes, of course I speak English.”

Best of all, you’ll feel at home while you’re there.

Because you’ll live with a host family that’s passionate about the value of cultural exchange, and excited to welcome you into their home, neighborhood, and town. Host families who have volunteered to be part of the EF community have been carefully selected and are often repeat hosts. And because we know them so well, we’re able to make it highly likely that the perfect match awaits you.

### SPREAD THREE: Why EF

**HEADLINE:** Don’t know the difference between a J–1 visa and an F–1 visa? It’s ok, we do.

**COPY:** EF has been creating memorable student exchange years since 1979. That’s over 100,000 exchanges. Needless to say, with that much experience, you build up an unmatched expertise on the subject.

For example, that experience has taught us the advantages of sponsoring students on a J–1 Exchange Visitor Visa, which upholds the highest standards of safety, quality, and cultural exchange.

The experience has also taught us how to best support students. It begins with guidance throughout the application process, carries through to a 12–step preparation course, and continues to the experience itself, where each student is paired with an on–site EF coordinator. And all along the way, students and their families have access to support 24/7. We don’t work with affiliate organizations – we know the best exchange experience happens when we see through every detail ourselves.

That’s what experience has taught us.

### SPREAD FOUR: EF All The Way

**HEADLINE AS MAIN VISUAL OR PROMINENTLY FEATURED:** EF All The Way

**COPY:** High School Exchange Year by EF is a not–for–profit organization. Which means all our revenue goes towards delivering an exceptional program. A program that would never accept handing off a student to a partner “on the ground” in the USA. In other words, when we say EF All The Way, that’s exactly what we mean.

_(NOTE: To demonstrate our mastery of the USA, we can add sidebars to spreads 2 and 3, which explore some of the unique quirks of US culture)_

**SIDEBAR EXAMPLE – Letterman Jacket**  
**HEADLINE:** The Anatomy of a Letter Jacket (NOTE: reference here)  
**VISUAL:** Letter jacket with callouts  
**CAPTION:** Everyone knows the famous American letter jackets. Not everyone knows what the patches symbolize.  
**CALLOUT (letter):** This means you made the varsity team. Congrats! The letter refers to the school name.  
**CALLOUT (name):** This is where your name goes. Or your nickname. It’s your call, really.  
**CALLOUT (graduation year patch):** This is the year you’ll graduate, assuming you study hard of course.  
**CALLOUT (sports letter patch):** These patches show the specific sport and year that you made the team.  
**CALLOUT (arrow to back but not shown):** Some people have a patch of their school’s school mascot on the back.

**SIDEBAR EXAMPLE – Regional Barbecue**  
**HEADLINE:** The Great Barbecue Rivalry (NOTE: reference here)  
**COPY:** Where can you find America’s best barbecue? It depends on who you ask…  
**VISUAL:** Kansas City BBQ  
**COPY:** Like your barbecue with a thick, smokey sauce? Kansas City–style BBQ might be your answer.  
**VISUAL:** Carolina BBQ  
**COPY:** Carolina comes in a few different regional varieties – all of them are a bit more vinegar–y.  
**VISUAL:** Memphis BBQ  
**COPY:** People in Memphis prefer their BBQ slow–smoked and dry–rubbed. None of that saucy mess here.  
**VISUAL:** Texas BBQ  
**COPY:** Don’t tell the other regions, but slow–cooked Texas BBQ is the best. (DID WE JUST WRITE THAT?!?)

## INBOUND > KEY WEBSITE PAGE

_(NOTE: The website home page uses HSEY’s more honest, confident, human tone to make stronger personal connections. For example, the headline will be tailored to whatever market the user is viewing the website – be it Norway, Germany, Italy, Taiwan, Brazil…)_

**HEADLINE:** At first, you’ll be “that new kid from Norway.”

**INTRO COPY:** It’s true. On day one of your exchange year in the United States, everyone will know you as “that kid from Norway.” But by day 30, who knows… Maybe you’ll be “that really funny kid from Norway.” Or “that amazing chess player from Norway.” Or just simply “that great photographer.” It’s one of the best things about spending a year of high school in America: You get to write your own story…

**CTA BUTTON:** I’ve heard enough; where do I apply?

**SUBHEAD:** Your exchange year will last a year. But it will never really end.  
**COPY:** Spend a year – or even a semester – attending high school in the United States, and you will develop the confidence and independence that will enrich you for the rest of your life.

**CALLOUT 1:** Live with a local family and experience American culture  
**CALLOUT 2:** Attend a local high school for a year or just a semester  
**CALLOUT 3:** Want to practice English? They speak a lot of it there…

**CTA BUTTON:** Apply now (to apply)  
**CTA BUTTON:** Hear more now (for information meeting)

**SUBHEAD:** Experience America with the people who know it best.  
**COPY:** High School Exchange Year by EF offers you the chance to attend high school in America with the people who’ve been creating extraordinary exchange years for students since 1979. We do it by seeing students through every step of the process ourselves – there’s never any partner agencies, never any handoff. We’ve seen the difference an exchange year with EF can make in someone’s life. Why not yours?  
**CTA BUTTON:** Our support network

**SUBHEAD:** Sure, you already have a family, And now, you’ll have two.  
**COPY:** You’ll be staying with a family during your exchange year. And families that host exchange students from EF are pretty much the best, if we don’t say so ourselves. Our host families are carefully selected and endlessly generous, and they’re doing it all without financial compensation because, quite simply, they’re passionate believers in the value of cultural exchange.  
**CTA BUTTON:** Our host families

**SUBHEAD:** America is the land of endless opportunities. There’s also a Walmart.  
**COPY:** To be sure, there are parts of America that are exactly like what you see in the movies. (Those old fashioned–looking diners with the waitresses who keep refilling your coffee? They’re JUST LIKE THAT!) But it’s quite possible that your most lasting memories of America will be the small moments. Tasting root beer. Making Chex mix with your host family. Standing in a Walmart, wondering why people need so many choices of cereal. At every turn, an extraordinary experience awaits you.

**SUBHEAD:** Hear more about EF’s exchange year from the people who lived it.  
**VISUAL:** AMBASSADOR POSTS

**POTENTIAL BLOG POST QUESTIONS:**

- what’s the unexpected memory you took away from your exchange year?
- What’s your fondest memory of your host family?
- Describe the moment you found out where you were going… then describe the comment you had to leave that place

## EXTRAS TO CONSIDER > HOST FAMILY COMMUNICATIONS

_(NOTE: Working on the project sparked a few additional ideas that could potentially be beneficial for HSEY…)_

We wonder: Should we create a half dozen messages that bring this voice to the recruitment of host families?

- **HEADLINE EXAMPLE:** Want to give an exchange student an unforgettable cultural experience? Buy them a root beer.
- **HEADLINE EXAMPLE:** An exchange student in the U.S. wants to see things that are beyond their imagination. Like, Target.

---

## EXTRAS TO CONSIDER > THE PATCH RITUAL

_(NOTE: Working on the project sparked a few additional ideas that could potentially be beneficial for HSEY…)_

We wonder: Per Jacob’s idea, do we consider creating a unique EF ritual by presenting patches for various exchange year achievements (similar to what you’d find on varsity/letter jackets)? Perhaps these could be given as a pack set to host families, and given as students achieve various goals, as a fun bonding activity?

**SAMPLE PATCHES:**

- **HL:** Yes I have an accent _(to be awarded upon first day of school)_
- **VISUAL:** Cookie crumbs, small pieces _(to be awarded upon first Crumbl Cookie experience)_
- **HL/LOGO:** Team Clean _(to be awarded upon first time a student helps clean the house, empties the dishwasher, etc)_
- **VISUAL:** pick up truck _(to be awarded first time the student, unprompted, “does something American”)_
- **VISUAL:** box of tissues _(to be awarded the first time a student does not cry during a call home)_
- **HL:** Um, like… _(to be awarded first time a student masters speaking an American phrase with a perfect American accent)_
- Et cetera

_(NOTE: We’re pretty sure host families and/or student ambassadors could come up with some great moments to commemorate…)_

---

## EXTRAS TO CONSIDER > YELLOW SCHOOL BUS TOUR

_(NOTE: Working on the project sparked a few additional ideas that could potentially be beneficial for HSEY…)_

We wonder: If the yellow school bus is such a quintessential symbol of America, does it make sense to bring one to Europe (or purchase/paint one already here)?

It could be used at events throughout Europe. Perhaps it could transport students during some pre–trip preparation gatherings. Or, it could become a famous centerpiece of an annual European tour, a la the Oscar Meyer Weinermobile…
